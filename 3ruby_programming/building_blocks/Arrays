Arrays: 
Arrays are ordered, integer indexed collections of any objects.

What are three ways to create an array?
  array=[] ;  array=Array.new ; %w[1 2 r 5] => ["1", "2", "r", "5"]
  array = Array.[](1, 2, 3, 4,5) ; array=Array[1,2,3] 

How do you prepopulate the array with default data?
  Array.new(3) => [nil, nil, nil]
  Array.new(3,5) => [5, 5, 5]

How do you access items in an array?
  arr=[1,2,35,6,8,9,10]
  arr[2] => 35; arr[-1] => 10; arr[2,4] => 35,6,8,9; arr[0..2] => 1,2,35
  arr.at(1) => 2 ; 
  To return the first n elements of an array:
  arr.take(3) => [1, 2, 35]
  arr.drop(3) => [8,9,10]

How can you access a specific group of items in an array?

How do you modify the items in an array? arr=[1,2,35,6,8,9,10]
  arr[4]=22 => [1, 2, 35, 6, 22, 9, 10]

How do you combine arrays?
  arr + arr1

How do you find the values in one array that aren't in another?

What is the difference between push/pop and shift/unshift?
  arr.push(3) will add 3 to the end of array
  arr.unshift(2,3) will add 2,3 to beginning of array
  arr.pop(n) will remove last n elements from the array
  arr.shift(n) will remove first n elements from the array


What is the shovel operator?

How is > arr.pop different from > arr[-1]?
  arr.pop removes last element and returns modified array; arr[-1] will
  return element at index position -1(last item), array will be unchanged

How is pushing or <<ing another array into your array different from just adding them together?
  arr1<<arr2 or arr1.push(arr2) will modify arr1 and arr2 will be included as subarray. arr1=[1,2] arr2=[5,6] arr1 << arr2 => [1,2,[5,6]]
  arr1+arr2 will create a new array [1,2,5,6] with original arrays unchanged

How do you delete items in an array?
  arr.pop(n) will remove last n elements from the array
  arr.shift(n) will remove first n elements from the array
  To delete at specific index 
  arr.delete_at(3) =>item at 3 will be removed from array.
  To delete all instances of a specific item
  arr.delete(2) all 2's will be removed

Why should you be careful deleting items in an array?
  why not?? what should you be not careful with??
